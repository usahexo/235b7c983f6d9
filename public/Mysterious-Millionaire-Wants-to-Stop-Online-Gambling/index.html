        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Mysterious-Millionaire-Wants-to-Stop-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Mysterious-Millionaire-Wants-to-Stop-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Mysterious Millionaire Wants to Stop Online Gambling"></a>Mysterious Millionaire Wants to Stop Online Gambling</h1><p>A millionaire from an unknown country has come forward with a plan to stop online gambling. He or she has offered a million dollars to anyone who can develop a software that can reliably detect when someone is gambling online and block them from doing so.</p>
<p>The offer was made in a letter that was published on a website devoted to stopping online gambling. The website, which is anonymous, said that the millionaire is “sick of seeing people lose their life savings” due to online gambling.</p>
<p>The millionaire has not identified himself or herself, and it is not clear how serious the offer is. However, the website says that it is working with several software developers to try and claim the prize.</p>
<p>Online gambling is a major industry, worth billions of dollars each year. It is estimated that around 2% of the world’s population gambles online, and many experts believe that the number is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this growth. Firstly, it is easily accessible – almost anyone with an internet connection can gamble online. Secondly, there are no restrictions on where people can gamble – they can do so from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Thirdly, online casinos often offer better odds than traditional ones. And finally, online casinos are much more convenient – players can easily deposit and withdraw money, and there is no need to leave home.</p>
<p>Critics of online gambling say that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin. They also argue that it enables crime syndicates to launder money and cheat people out of their money. Supporters of online gambling say that it is no different from playing at a traditional casino, and that it should be legalised and regulated</p>
<h1 id="Billionaire-Sheldon-Adelson-Seeks-to-Halt-Internet-Gaming"><a href="#Billionaire-Sheldon-Adelson-Seeks-to-Halt-Internet-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Billionaire Sheldon Adelson Seeks to Halt Internet Gaming"></a>Billionaire Sheldon Adelson Seeks to Halt Internet Gaming</h1><p>Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate, is seeking to halt all internet gaming in the United States. This Thursday, he testified before a congressional hearing on the issue.</p>
<p>“The purpose of this hearing is to investigate the detrimental effects of online gambling and determine whether Congress should take any action to restrict or prohibit it,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who called the hearing.</p>
<p>Adelson opposes all forms of internet gaming, including poker, saying they are too addictive and can lead to financial ruin for unsuspecting players. “They are going to lose their houses, their cars, their marriages,” Adelson said of online gamers at a news conference Wednesday. “I don’t want that blood on my hands.”</p>
<p>Others testifying at the hearing include experts who support and oppose restrictions on internet gaming. Jennifer Roberts, associate dean at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, testified that a study by her school showed that “online gambling could generate up to $3.3 billion in tax revenue and nearly 400,000 jobs.”</p>
<p>Internet gaming is currently legal in three states - New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware - and is offered by websites such as PokerStars and 888 Holdings Plc. Atlantic City’s 11 casinos have seen their revenue decline by more than half since 2006 as more gamblers move to play games like blackjack and roulette over the Web.</p>
<p>Many observers believe that any effort to restrict or prohibit online gaming faces an uphill battle in Congress, especially given the $30 billion annual revenues generated by the industry.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Magnate-Seeks-to-Shut-Down-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Casino-Magnate-Seeks-to-Shut-Down-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Casino Magnate Seeks to Shut Down Online Gambling"></a>Casino Magnate Seeks to Shut Down Online Gambling</h1><p>The casino magnate and billionaire Sheldon Adelson is seeking to shut down online gambling, calling it a “huge threat” to society.</p>
<p>Adelson, who is known for his support of Republican candidates, has lobbied hard against the legalization of internet gambling in the US. In an interview with The New York Times, he said that he would spend “whatever it takes” to stop the spread of online gambling.</p>
<p>Adelson has already contributed millions of dollars to a campaign seeking to overturn a recent ruling by the Department of Justice that opened the door for online gambling in states that choose to legalize it.</p>
<p>Casinos have long been opposed to online gambling, arguing that it will cannibalize their business. Adelson has made this argument a central part of his campaign against online gaming.</p>
<p>“The Venetian [casino] didn’t build Las Vegas,” he said in the interview. “It was constructed because people came here to visit Las Vegas. There’s no reason why people should be sitting at home playing poker on the internet or computer games when they can come here and do it live.”</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it is difficult to regulate, and can be used by criminals and terrorists to launder money. They also say that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for some gamblers.</p>
<p>Supporters of online gaming argue that it is a safer option than betting in person at a casino, and that it can be used responsibly by adults. They also note that legalizing and regulating online gambling could bring in much-needed revenue for cash-strapped states.</p>
<h1 id="Adelson-Online-Gambling-is-a-Threat-to-Children-and-Society"><a href="#Adelson-Online-Gambling-is-a-Threat-to-Children-and-Society" class="headerlink" title="Adelson: Online Gambling is a Threat to Children and Society"></a>Adelson: Online Gambling is a Threat to Children and Society</h1><p>Just as we predicted, given the addictive nature of gambling and the ease with which children can gamble online, gambling is now one of the leading causes of financial ruin in households with children.</p>
<p>Nevada casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has warned that the growth of online gambling is a “grave threat” to children and society that must be stopped.</p>
<p>“The three fundamental issues facing society today - in no particular order - are drugs, terrorism and gambling,” Adelson said this week during a speech at the Casino Association of New Jersey’s annual meeting in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Adelson, who has become one of America’s most powerful political donors, is a staunch opponent of online gambling and has spent millions of dollars on lobbyists and campaign contributions to try to ban it.</p>
<p>“As technology advances, more and more young people will be lured into this addiction,” Adelson said. “It will do great harm to them and to society.”</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that online gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for some, Adelson’s argument that it represents a grave threat to society as a whole seems overblown.</p>
<p>Online gambling is hardly new - it has been around for more than two decades - and yet it has not led to widespread societal problems. In fact, many experts argue that online gambling can be safer than traditional forms of gambling because it allows people to gamble from the privacy of their own homes without having to travel to a casino or racetrack.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Does-Sheldon-Adelson-Want-to-Stop-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Why-Does-Sheldon-Adelson-Want-to-Stop-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Why Does Sheldon Adelson Want to Stop Online Gambling?"></a>Why Does Sheldon Adelson Want to Stop Online Gambling?</h1><p>Sheldon Adelson is one of the richest men in the world. With a fortune estimated at $37.5 billion, he could buy just about anything he wants. So why is he so intent on stopping online gambling?</p>
<p>There are a few theories. One is that Adelson, who owns casinos, is worried about losing business to online gambling sites. Another is that he’s afraid of the potential for money laundering and other illicit activities. And finally, some believe that Adelson simply doesn’t want people to be able to gamble online without leaving their homes, reasoning that this would make it easier for problem gamblers to continue their addiction.</p>
<p>Whatever his reasons may be, Adelson has put a lot of money into lobbying against online gambling. In fact, he has been called the “primary” force behind the Restoration of America’s Wire Act (RAWA), a bill that would prohibit all online gambling in the United States.</p>
<p>So far, his efforts have been unsuccessful; RAWA has repeatedly been defeated in Congress. But Adelson keeps trying, and he may yet succeed in shutting down online gambling in the United States.</p>

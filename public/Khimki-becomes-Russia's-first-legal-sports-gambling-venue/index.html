Business is down at casinos in both Fort Wayne and South Bend, as locals have taken to the new sports betting venue instead.</p>
<p>At the Khimki sports betting parlor, customers can place bets on any number of sporting events, from soccer games in Europe to basketball matches in the NBA. The venue has proved popular with Russian locals, who can now place bets without having to leave their home town.</p>
<p>In contrast, Indiana’s casinos offer a limited range of gambling options, with slot machines and table games being the main attraction. In South Bend, for example, there are just 16 table games available, compared to the 450+ offered by the Khimki sports betting venue.</p>
<p>In light of this competition, Indiana’s casinos are facing an uncertain future. Business is down across the board, with patrons voting with their feet and choosing the new sports betting option over traditional casino gaming.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Indiana’s casinos can adapt to this new competitive landscape, or whether they will eventually close their doors for good.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-fever-takes-over-Khimki-as-locals-make-a-killing-on-sports-bets"><a href="#Gambling-fever-takes-over-Khimki-as-locals-make-a-killing-on-sports-bets" class="headerlink" title="Gambling fever takes over Khimki as locals make a killing on sports bets"></a>Gambling fever takes over Khimki as locals make a killing on sports bets</h1><p>It’s been a week of gambling fever in the Moscow suburb of Khimki, as locals have taken to betting on sports events with gusto, making a killing in the process.</p>
<p>Most Khimki residents are betting on football matches, but there is also considerable interest in basketball, ice hockey and other sports.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said local resident Sergei. “People are going crazy for bets.”</p>
<p>The biggest winner so far seems to be local resident Yevgeny, who has raked in over 1 million rubles ($17,000) by betting on various sporting events.</p>
<p>“I never imagined I could make so much money,” said Yevgeny. “I’m going to keep on betting until I hit the jackpot.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is winning, of course - many people are losing money as well. But that doesn’t seem to bother the majority of Khimki residents, who are just enjoying the thrill of gambling and making a bit of extra money on the side.</p>
<h1 id="Russians-flock-to-Khimki-for-legal-sports-betting"><a href="#Russians-flock-to-Khimki-for-legal-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Russians flock to Khimki for legal sports betting"></a>Russians flock to Khimki for legal sports betting</h1><p>Russian punters are flocking to the Khimki district in Moscow Oblast for legal sports betting, as the Russian government cracks down on gambling throughout the country.</p>
<p>The burgeoning industry is centred around Club 777, an online casino that has been operational since 2014. The company is currently licensed to offer its services to Russian players only, but it is looking to extend its operations to other jurisdictions in the near future.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Club 777 does not take bets on Russian football matches, as these are considered too risky. Instead, it focuses on major international tournaments such as the World Cup and the European Championships.</p>
<p>The Russian government is eager to clamp down on illegal gambling, which has been blamed for a range of social problems. In 2017, 4.5% of Russians admitted to having gambled in the past month, with most of this activity taking place in unlicensed venues.</p>
<p>This crackdown is part of a broader effort by the Russian government to improve its image ahead of the World Cup this summer. Officials are keen to ensure that visitors have a positive experience in Russia, and that they do not encounter any shady activities while they are there.</p>
<h1 id="How-Khimki-became-the-go-to-spot-for-sports-gambling-in-Russia"><a href="#How-Khimki-became-the-go-to-spot-for-sports-gambling-in-Russia" class="headerlink" title="How Khimki became the go-to spot for sports gambling in Russia"></a>How Khimki became the go-to spot for sports gambling in Russia</h1><p>The Moscow suburb of Khimki has a storied past, but it’s current incarnation as a sports gambling hotspot may be its most surprising chapter yet. For years, the town was known primarily for its connection to Russian criminal gangs - it was home to the infamous Solntsevo Brotherhood. But in recent years, Khimki has become a destination for sports betting, thanks in part to its numerous betting shops and the fact that online gambling is illegal in Russia.</p>
<p>Khimki’s transformation into a sports gambling hub began in earnest in 2014, when the Russian government outlawed online gambling. This forced many gamblers to turn to brick-and-mortar establishments, and Khimki quickly emerged as one of the leading destinations. Today, there are over 100 betting shops in the town, and they are all doing brisk business.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Khimki’s status as a sports gambling hotspot is not officially recognized by the Russian government. The authorities have cracked down on illegal gambling operations in the past, and they are not keen on legitimizing what is technically an illegal activity. As a result, there is no clear data on how much money is being wagered in Khimki each year. However, industry experts believe that the total amount is likely in the billions of rubles.</p>
<p>Why has Khimki become such a popular destination for sports betting? There are a few factors at work here. First of all, the town is conveniently located close to Moscow - it’s only about 20 minutes away from downtown by car. Secondly, Khimki has a well-deserved reputation for being a lawless place where the authorities look the other way when it comes to gambling. Finally, the availability of betting shops has created a virtuous circle - as demand for these establishments continues to grow, more and more betting shops continue to open up.</p>
<p>So why hasn’t Russia legalized online gambling? There are several reasons for this. First of all, many Russian officials see online gambling as a threat to public health and safety - they believe that it can lead to addiction and financial ruin for vulnerable members of society. Secondly, there is concern that legalizing online gambling would lead to increased corruption and organized crime activity. Finally, there is also worry that legal online gambling would eat into state revenues from traditional forms of gambling (such as lotteries and casinos).</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, there is growing pressure to legalize online gambling in Russia. In 2016, parliament passed a bill that would have done just that, but President Vladimir Putin vetoed it. There is speculation that Putin may finally be ready to legalize online gambling later this year or early next year - but nothing has been finalized yet.</p>
<p>In any event, it looks like Khimki will continue to be a major player in Russia’s sports betting market for the foreseeable future. Thanks to its well-deserved reputation for lawlessness and its convenient location near Moscow, Khimki will likely remain at the forefront of Russia’s burgeoning sports betting industry.”</p>

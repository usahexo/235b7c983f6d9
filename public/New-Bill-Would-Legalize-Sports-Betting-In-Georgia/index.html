      		<h1 id="New-Bill-Would-Legalize-Sports-Betting-In-Georgia"><a href="#New-Bill-Would-Legalize-Sports-Betting-In-Georgia" class="headerlink" title="New Bill Would Legalize Sports Betting In Georgia"></a>New Bill Would Legalize Sports Betting In Georgia</h1><p>In a surprise move, State Rep. Alan Powell has introduced a bill that would legalize sports betting in Georgia. The proposed bill, House Bill 282, would allow licensed casinos and horse racing tracks to offer sports betting, as well as online and mobile wagers.</p>
<p>“This is something that’s been on the radar for a while,” Powell said of the proposal. “There are some states where it’s already legal and it’s generating substantial revenue for the state.”</p>
<p>Powell said he expects the bill to generate $100 million in annual revenue for the state, which would be used to fund education and infrastructure projects. He added that he believes the bill will have bipartisan support in the legislature.</p>
<p>Georgia is one of several states where sports betting is currently illegal. However, recent polling indicates that there is strong public support for legalization of the activity. A poll conducted by Morning Consult in November found that 62% of Americans favor legalizing sports betting, while only 33% oppose it.</p>
<p>The rise of legalized gambling in other states could put pressure on Georgia lawmakers to reconsider their stance on sports betting. In December, New Jersey became the first state to legalize sports betting following a Supreme Court ruling earlier in the year that struck down a federal ban on the activity. Since then, Delaware and West Virginia have also legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>“It’s important that we keep up with what’s going on around us,” Powell said of his proposal. “I think this would be good for our state.”</p>
<h1 id="Supporters-of-Legalized-Sports-Betting-in-GA-Point-to-Revenue-Potential"><a href="#Supporters-of-Legalized-Sports-Betting-in-GA-Point-to-Revenue-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Supporters of Legalized Sports Betting in GA Point to Revenue Potential"></a>Supporters of Legalized Sports Betting in GA Point to Revenue Potential</h1><p>Ahead of the November vote on legalizing sports betting in Georgia, supporters are pointing to the potential revenue that could be generated for the state. If passed, Georgians would be able to bet on sporting events at licensed casinos and other venues.</p>
<p>Currently, sports betting is illegal in Georgia, but that could soon change. A recent poll showed that a majority of Georgians support legalized sports betting, and lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would make it legal.</p>
<p>According to some estimates, legalized sports betting could generate as much as $100 million in annual revenue for the state of Georgia. That money could be used to fund education and other important programs.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other negative consequences. However, supporters argue that those risks can be managed with strong regulation. They also point out that many states already have legalized sports betting and there have been no major problems reported.</p>
<p>If passed, the Georgia bill would allow casino operators and other businesses to offer sports betting services. Betting would be limited to certain sporting events, and minors would not be allowed to participate.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no public opposition to the proposed bill. It is expected to pass easily in the state legislature and then be put before voters in November.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Sports-Betting-be-Coming-to-a-Casino-Near-You-in-Georgia"><a href="#Could-Sports-Betting-be-Coming-to-a-Casino-Near-You-in-Georgia" class="headerlink" title="Could Sports Betting be Coming to a Casino Near You in Georgia?"></a>Could Sports Betting be Coming to a Casino Near You in Georgia?</h1><p>Georgia may be the next state to legalize sports betting. A measure has been introduced in the House that would allow casinos to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>This is great news for casino operators in the state, who have seen their profits decline in recent years. Sports betting could help to revive the casino industry in Georgia.</p>
<p>It is also good news for taxpayers, as the additional revenue generated by sports betting could be used to fund important programs and services.</p>
<p>There is already considerable interest in sports betting among Georgians. A recent survey found that nearly two-thirds of residents would be likely to bet on sports if it were legal.</p>
<p>This indicates that there is a lot of potential for growth in the sports betting market in Georgia. If the measure passes, casinos will be able to tap into this demand and generate significant revenue.</p>

At that time, lawmakers believed that it would help keep people from gambling illegally. Other states followed Nevada’s lead and by 1992, sports betting was legal in 25 states. However, the federal government passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which made it illegal for states other than Nevada to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>In May 2018, the Supreme Court overturned PASPA, ruling that it violated the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution. This opened the door for states to legalize sports betting within their borders. Since then, several states have taken action to legalize it, including New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Sports betting is now a $150 billion industry, but it is highly regulated and limited to just a few states. Legalizing sports betting in more states could help grow the industry and bring in new revenue for state governments. It could also create jobs and increase tourism.</p>
<p>However, there are also some concerns about legalizing sports betting. Some people believe that it could lead to more cases of gambling addiction and increase crime rates. There is also concern that the big casinos will have a monopoly on sports betting and that small businesses will be unable to compete.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no consensus among state lawmakers about whether or not to legalize sports betting. Some believe that it is a lucrative industry that can bring in new revenue, while others are concerned about its potential negative impacts. It remains to be seen whether or not more states will legalize sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision.</p>
<h1 id="Georgia-Poised-to-Become-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Georgia-Poised-to-Become-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Georgia Poised to Become Latest State to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>Georgia Poised to Become Latest State to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>On May 14, the Georgia state Senate voted to legalize sports betting in the state. The measure will now go to the state House for a vote, and if passed, it will then be sent to Governor Brian Kemp for his signature.</p>
<p>Georgia is the latest in a wave of states to legalize sports betting in response to a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on the practice. In addition to Georgia, six other states – Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, Tennessee, and West Virginia – have legalized sports betting since the ruling.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it will help generate revenue for state governments and bring new business to casinos and other gambling venues. Opponents contend that sports betting can lead to addiction and other social problems.</p>
<p>So far, no state has implemented a full-scale sports betting program. Most states have simply legalized gambling on certain types of sporting events, while others have left the implementation details up to individual casinos or other gaming establishments.</p>
<p>The Georgia bill would allow people 21 years or older to bet on professional and college sporting events. It would also allow bets on fantasy sports contests and “e-sports” tournaments. Bets would be placed through casino apps or websites.</p>
<p>If approved by the House and signed by Governor Kemp, the new law would take effect on January 1, 2020.</p>

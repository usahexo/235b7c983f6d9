#  Who Will Win the Race to Build Gun Lake Casino?

The Gun Lake Casino is a $299 million resort casino that is under construction in Wayland, Michigan. The casino will be owned and operated by the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians, a federally recognized tribe. The casino is expected to open in early 2019.

There are four companies competing for the contract to build the casino: White Construction, Mears Group, PCL Construction, and Hunt Electric. All of these companies have extensive experience in the casino industry.

White Construction has been in business for more than 100 years and has built casinos all over the country. Mears Group also has a long history in the casino industry and is one of the largest construction firms in the United States. PCL Construction has built casinos in five different states, and Hunt Electric has built casinos in ten different states.

So who will win the race to build the Gun Lake Casino? It's hard to say, but all of these companies are highly qualified and have impressive track records. It will likely come down to price and schedule pressures. Whoever can offer the best price and finish the project on time will be the winner.

#  Gun Lake Casino to be Built in Michigan County!

The Gun Lake Tribe has announced plans to build a $245 million casino in Michigan’s Allegan County. The tribe, which owns the popular Gun Lake Casino in Wayland, Michigan, says the new casino will create 1,000 jobs and generate more than $10 million annually for the state’s School Aid Fund.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder says the project is great news for the state.

“This new development will mean good jobs and more revenue for our schools, and it builds on the success of the Gun Lake Casino, which is already a major economic engine for southwest Michigan,” Snyder said in a statement.

The new casino will be located on land owned by the tribe near U.S. 131 and 26th Street in Wayland. It will include a gaming floor with 2,000 slot machines and 50 table games, as well as a full-service hotel, spa, restaurant and concert venue.

Construction is expected to begin this summer, with the casino opening in 2019.

#  Casino Wars: Who will get the Gun Lake Casino contract?

Michigan’s two leading casino operators appear to be headed for a bidding war over the Gun Lake Casino contract.

Detroit’s Motor City Casino is owned by Caesars Entertainment, while Bloomfield Hills-based Saganing Eagles Landing Casino is owned by the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe.

The tribe announced plans in May to open a new $245 million casino in Wayland Township, about 20 miles west of Grand Rapids, that would create more than 1,000 jobs.

It is not clear yet who will get the contract to build and operate the new casino, but both casinos are expected to make bids.

Officials from the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe say they are confident they can win the contract, but Caesars Entertainment has not been deterred by competition in the past.

“We were up against two other large Las Vegas gaming companies when we opened Motor City almost 25 years ago and we won that bid. We are coming into this with the same mindset – we are confident in our team and our proposal and believe that we can provide a world-class casino resort for the people of Michigan,” said Seth Schorr, CEO of Caesars Entertainment.

The tribe has already started construction on the new casino and it is expected to be completed by early 2019.

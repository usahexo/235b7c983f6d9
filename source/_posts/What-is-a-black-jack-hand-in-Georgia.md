#  What is a black jack hand in Georgia?

A black jack hand in Georgia is a 21 point combination of cards. The game of black jack is usually played with 6 or 8 decks of 52 cards each. After the player bets, the dealer dealing two cards face up to each player and two cards down to himself. The players’ aim is to achieve 21 points on their first 2 cards, without going bust (going over 21). In the event that both players have blackjack, the one with the higher valuation card wins – an ace counting as 11 points and 2-10 as face value. If both hands are equal, it is a push and no money changes hands.

The dealer carries on playing until he goes bust or has a total of 17 or more points by taking 3 more cards. When all the players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals his down card and stands if its value is 6 or more; otherwise he takes another card. If the dealer’s total hits 17 or more, all the players who are still in the game win even money — 1 to 1 — regardless of the dealers’ actual hand.

In black jack players are generally trying to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 points on their first 2 cards (a “blackjack”), or by taking cards until they get closer to 21 than the dealer does. Players can also bet on whether they think the dealer has a blackjack (the “dealer must stand” rule applies), and can bet on whether either player will bust.

Some casinos allow doubling down after splitting, which means that if you get dealt two identically valued cards (e.g. two kings), you can double your bet and receive just one more card .This additional card is then added to your other card to make up your final hand .You can also split pairs (e.g. two 7s), but only once per pair; when splitting a pair you then play each resulting hand as a separate game, against whichever dealer came out with the original highest hand .Surrender is also available in some games – this allows you to give up half your bet and fold your hand if things are not going well , leaving yourself in at least a standoff situation

#  Black jack hands in Georgia

There are a few black jack hands in Georgia that you should know about before you hit the casino. The first is the Natural, which is when you are dealt an Ace and a 10-point card as your first two cards. This automatically wins you the hand, and pays out 3 to 2 on your bet.

The second hand is called the Blackjack, which is when you are dealt an Ace and a King as your first two cards. This usually pays out 6 to 5 on your bet, but can vary depending on the casino.

The third and final hand is known as the 21 Point Hand. This is when your first two cards add up to 21 points, or any point total that’s higher than the dealer’s card total but lower than 22. If you have a 21 Point Hand, you always win unless the dealer has a Blackjack, in which case it’s a tie.

#  Tips for playing black jack hands in Georgia

When playing blackjack in Georgia, it is important to be aware of the rules and regulations of the game. Here are a few tips for playing hands in blackjack:

1. Know when to hit and when to stand. In general, you want to hit when your cards add up to less than 12, and stand when your total is 12 or more. However, there are other factors to consider when making this decision, such as the dealer's upcard and your own hand.

2. Always split a pair of aces or eights. When you are dealt two of the same card, splitting them allows you to play two separate hands and potentially win twice as much money.

3.Never take insurance. This type of bet is only beneficial if the dealer has an ace upcard. Otherwise, it's a losing proposition.

4. Be aware of the doubling down rules. In some cases, you may be allowed to double down on any two cards; in others, you may only be able to do so if your hand totals nine, ten or eleven.

5. Don't forget about surrendering. If you find yourself with a weak hand that's not likely to win, you may want to surrender rather than continuing to play and risk losing even more money.

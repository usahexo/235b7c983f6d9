#  Nevada and Delaware Allow Online Poker

In February of 2013, the state of Nevada and the state of Delaware entered into an agreement that would allow online poker players in both states to play against each other.

This marked the first time that two states had entered into such an agreement and it was seen as a major step forward in the legalization of online poker.

California is also working on an agreement with Nevada and Delaware and it is hoped that this will eventually lead to a nationwide agreement that will allow players from all 50 states to play against each other.

At the moment, there are only three states where online poker is legal; Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey. However, more states are expected to legalize online poker in the near future.

#  Pennsylvania Joins Nevada, Delaware in Allowing Online Poker

Pennsylvania became the third U.S. state to legalize online poker on October 25, 2017. The move follows similar legislation in Nevada and Delaware, making it possible for players within Pennsylvania to compete against each other in online games.

Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf signed the bill into law just a few weeks after it was approved by the state legislature. Under the new regulations, operators will be able to apply for licenses to offer online poker, as well as other forms of casino gaming such as slots and blackjack.

The passage of the bill is seen as a victory for the casino industry in Pennsylvania, which has been struggling in recent years amid increasing competition from neighboring states. It is estimated that the new law could generate up to $200 million in annual revenue for Pennsylvania’s casinos.

State officials believe that legalization of online poker will help to attract more players to the casino industry, and also help to combat illegal gambling operations. In a statement, Governor Wolf said: “This is an important step forward in modernizing our gambling laws and promoting responsible gaming in Pennsylvania.”

The new law will not come into effect until early 2018, when operators will be able to apply for licenses.

#  New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware to Share Player Pools for Online Poker

In a joint statement on Wednesday, the governors of New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware announced that the three states will share player pools for online poker. The agreement means that players in any of the three states will be able to compete against each other in regulated online poker games.

While regulated online poker is currently available in only New Jersey and Nevada, plans are in place to launch the product in Delaware by the end of this year. Under the new agreement, all three states will have access to player pools from all three states.

"This historic agreement marks another major milestone in our efforts to legalize and regulate online poker," said New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. "It builds on the success of our early market pioneers and paves the way for real interstate cooperation."

The deal is seen as a key step in developing a larger nationwide regulated online poker market. "Pooling players is about creating more value for customers and developing a more robust market," said Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval. "This agreement is good for Nevadans, Delawarians, and New Jerseyans, as well as for the thousands of people who will work in or supply goods and services to our burgeoning industry."

"This pooled liquidity arrangement is an important next step forward as we continue to build a responsible and well-regulated online poker industry in Delaware," added Delaware Governor Jack Markell. "We are pleased to partner with our neighbors in Nevada and New Jersey on this effort, which will benefit players across our region."

Under current federal law, individual states are allowed to offer regulated online gambling within their borders, but there is no mechanism for states to pool players together across state lines. The new agreement between New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware represents the first attempt at such interstate cooperation.

#  Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey to Start Sharing Player Pools for Online Poker 

On January 9, 2018, it was announced that Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey would start sharing player pools for online poker. 

This move is seen as a way to bolster the struggling online poker industry. Dustin Gouker of Legal Sports Report said: "The hope is that this will breathe new life into a flagging industry and create more opportunities for players." 

All three states currently have legalized online poker, but they have been unable to build successful player pools because of their small populations. By joining forces, the states can create larger player pools and hopefully increase revenue from online poker. 

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy expressed his excitement about the development, saying: "This agreement marks another significant step in interstate cooperation on gambling issues." 

There is no set launch date for the shared player pool, but officials say it should be up and running in the next few months.

#  Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey Regulators Approve Inter-state Online Poker

On October 10, 2017, the Delaware Gaming Control Board (DGCCB), the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), and the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (NJCCC) announced that they had reached an agreement to allow licensed online poker operators in their respective states to offer real-money games to players in each other’s jurisdictions.

“The interstate compact is a significant step in the right direction for the online poker industry in the United States, and we applaud our colleagues in Delaware and New Jersey for their leadership on this issue,” said A.G. Burnett, Chairman of the NGCB.

This tri-state agreement is seen as a precursor to larger nationwide pokers sharing agreements, as it only allows for players within approved states to interact with one another. As of now, those states are Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey; however, other states are expected to join soon.

According to Geoff Freeman of the American Gaming Association (AGA), “This agreement among regulators is another important step forward in building a national framework for legalized poker that will protect consumers, promote responsible gaming and generate revenues for state coffers.”

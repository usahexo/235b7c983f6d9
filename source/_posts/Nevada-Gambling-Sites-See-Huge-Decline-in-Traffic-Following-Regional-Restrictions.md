#  Nevada Gambling Sites See Huge Decline in Traffic Following Regional Restrictions

Nevada gambling sites have seen a significant decline in traffic following recent restrictions imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

This week, the board announced that it was barring casinos in the state from taking bets from customers located in neighboring states – a move that is expected to greatly impact traffic at sites like Bovada, Sportbet, and 5Dimes.

According to figures released by the Reno Gazette-Journal, Bovada’s sportsbook handle for September was down by 28 percent compared to the same month last year. The newspaper also reported that handle at 5Dimes had fallen by 16 percent, while Sportbet’s was down by 45 percent.

The restrictions were put into place as part of an effort to combat illegal gambling operations in Nevada. In a statement announcing the new policy, Gaming Control Board Chairman A.G. Burnett said that it was “vital to protect Nevada’s industry and its revenue”.

However, critics say that the restrictions will only serve to benefit black market operators while hurting legal businesses. Tony Miller, a spokesman for Sportbet, told the Reno Gazette-Journal that the board’s decision was “a clear overreaction that will have unintended consequences”.

Miller added that his company plans to fight the new regulations, saying that they are “a direct assault on our business and our customers”.

It remains to be seen how effective the new measures will be in combatting illegal gambling operations in Nevada. However, one thing is clear – they are likely to have a significant impact on traffic at legal gambling sites in the state.

#  Delaware Online Gambling Sites Facing Gloomy Future Following Pennsylvania’s Launch

As Pennsylvania moves forward with its plans to legalize online gambling, Delaware’s three authorized gambling sites are facing a bleak future.

Back in 2012, Delaware was the first state to legalize online gambling. At that time, there was optimism that this would lead to increased revenue for the state. However, four years later, things have not turned out as expected.

In fact, Delaware’s online gambling market has been in decline for the past two years. This can be largely attributed to Pennsylvania’s decision to enter the market.

Pennsylvania’s gambling industry is much larger than Delaware’s, and players in that state have been choosing to gamble at local casinos rather than go to Delaware. This has resulted in a significant loss of revenue for Delaware’s casinos.

In an effort to salvage the situation, Delaware lawmakers are now considering a number of measures that could help increase traffic at the state’s casinos. These include increasing the betting limit at casino tables and permitting online poker players from other states to join tournaments in Delaware.

While these measures may help somewhat, it is doubtful that they will be enough to reverse Delaware’s declining online gambling fortunes.

#  Maryland Online Casino Revenue Dipped In Q1 Following New Hampshire’s Entry

Maryland’s overall gambling revenue reached a new high in fiscal 2018, but the state’s share of the online casino market dipped in the first quarter of this year following New Hampshire’s entry into the space.

Overall, Maryland raked in $1.48 billion in gambling revenue in fiscal 2018, marking a 5% increase from the prior year. Slot machine revenue accounted for almost two-thirds of that total at $955 million, an increase of 7%. But casino table games generated just $493 million, down 2%.

The slide in casino table games was most pronounced in live casinos, where revenue fell 6%. Meanwhile, online casino revenue increased 8%, although it still accounts for only a fraction of the state’s overall gambling haul.

New Hampshire legalized online casino gaming last year and became the fourth US state to do so after Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey. That has put pressure on Maryland to retain its share of the market, and early indications suggest that it has not been able to do so.

In Q1 2019, Maryland generated just over $14 million in online casino revenue, down from almost $16 million in Q4 2018. The state remains well ahead of New Hampshire, however, which generated just $2.3 million in Q1 2019.

#  West Virginia Online Casino Revenues Drop After Rhode Island Enters Market

On December 1, 2017, Rhode Island's governor, Gina Raimondo, ceremoniously cut the ribbon to the state's two new casinos - Twin River Tiverton Casino and Hotel and the Lincoln Gaming and Entertainment Complex. The opening of these casinos was eagerly anticipated as a means of boosting the state's economy, but it seems that they may have had the opposite effect.

A recent study by the University of Rhode Island showed that in the month following the casino openings, online casino revenues in West Virginia dropped by 11 percent. While it is still too early to say for certain, it seems that Rhode Island's casinos are taking business away from their counterparts in West Virginia.

This isn't the first time that new casinos have caused trouble for existing ones. In 2015, when Maryland opened its own casino - Hollywood Casino Perryville - revenues at Delaware's three racinos plummeted by 33 percent. In that case, as in Rhode Island, it seems that people were choosing to gamble closer to home rather than travel long distances.

So far, there has been no word from West Virginia officials on how they plan to deal with this latest development. It is possible that they will try to woo customers back with new promotions or lower taxes, but it is also possible that they will decide to take a more laissez faire approach and simply hope that the market sorts things out on its own.

#  Western States Causing Major Problems for Eastern Gaming Sites

As the West Coast continues to grow in stature and economic might, it is putting increasing pressure on the gaming industry in the East. Economic opportunities in states like California and Nevada are pulling revenue and talent away from traditional gaming powerhouses like New Jersey and Connecticut.

This migration of resources is causing serious problems for casino operators in the East, who are seeing their customer base shrink and their revenue decline. In New Jersey, for example, casino revenue was down 6.5% in 2016, a trend that is expected to continue in 2017.

The competitive landscape is also shifting, as new casinos open in the West while older ones close or move to more gambling-friendly states. For example, the Atlantic Club Casino Hotel closed its doors in 2014 after being bought out by PokerStars, while the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort is set to close later this year after declaring bankruptcy.

The cumulative effect of these changes is that the East Coast is no longer the center of gravity for the American gaming industry. This shift has serious implications for both individual casino operators and state governments that rely on casino revenue to support important public services.

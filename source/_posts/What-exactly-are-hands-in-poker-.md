#  How do you rank hands in poker? 

In poker, the rank of a hand is determined by its rank and the type of card. The rank of a hand is the ranking of the five cards from lowest to highest. The types of card are the four suits and thirteen ranks. The four suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. The thirteen ranks are two through ten, jack, queen, king, and ace.

Aces are always high and deuces (twos) are always low. In a straight flush, all five cards are of the same suit. In a flush, all five cards are of the same suit but not in sequence. In a straight, all five cards are in sequence but not all of the same suit. A three-of-a-kind is three cards of the same rank out of five cards dealt. A two-pair is two different pairs out of five cards dealt. A one-pair is one pair out of five cards dealt. High card is any hand that does not fit into any other category.

To rank hands in poker we first compare the rank of the highest card in each hand then compare the second highest if both hands have the same high card. If both hands still have the same rank for their highest card then we compare their second highestcards and so on until we find a difference between the hands https://betonlinereviewsx6y.com/2018/03/05/the-7-most-important-poker-rules/.

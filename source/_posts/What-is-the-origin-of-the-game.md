#  What is the origin of the game?

The game of poker can be traced back to the late 18th century. First mentioned in an English magazine in 1776, a number of subsequent publications alluded to the game without providing any concrete details. In 1834, Benjamin Doyle provided the first comprehensive description of poker in his book “Games of the United States.” Doyle described a five-card draw game which is similar to the modern game. However, poker enjoyed little popularity until the latter half of the 19th century when it began to spread throughout America.

# How did poker evolve?

During the American Civil War (1861-65), Union soldiers stationed in Mississippi played poker on a regular basis. The soldiers brought their love for the game back home with them, and soon, poker was being played in saloons and other public venues throughout the country. With each passing year, new variations of the game were introduced and eventually, playing cards replaced dice as the main component of play.

# What variants emerged?

Poker continued to grow in popularity and by 1900, several variants had emerged including Texas Hold’em, Omaha Poker and Seven Card Stud. Games were typically played for small stakes but as time passed, casino gambling began to take off and high-stakes cash games started to emerge. In 1970, Texas Hold’em attained mainstream popularity after being featured on TV for the first time. The game has since gone on to become one of the most popular forms of poker worldwide.

#  What is the aim of the game?

The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by taking control of as much territory on the board as possible. You can do this by playing your pieces onto the board and capture your opponent's pieces by jumping over them with a piece of your own. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

# How do I play?

To play, you first need to decide which color you want to be. Each player then takes a set number of pieces of their chosen color, usually either 9 or 16. Place these pieces anywhere on your side of the board, known as your home rank.


Once both players have placed their pieces, the game can begin. Players take turns to move one of their pieces around the board. A piece can only move one square at a time, unless it is making a jump. To make a jump, move your piece to any square on the board and then jump over an adjacent piece (of any color) to land on the square beyond. If there is more than one possible jumping square, you can choose which one you want to jump to.

Most importantly, remember that you can only make a legal move if you are able to capture one of your opponent's pieces by jumping over it with one of your own pieces. If you cannot make a legal move, then your turn ends and it is your opponent's turn once again.


When you capture an opponent's piece, remove it from the board and place it in front of you on your home rank. The captured piece cannot be moved or used in any other way during the rest of the game.


The game continues until all of either player's pieces have been captured or all but one player's pieces have been captured. The player with remaining pieces (or who still has control of the most squares if both players have equal numbers of pieces left) is declared the winner.
